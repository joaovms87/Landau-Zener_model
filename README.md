# Landau-Zener_model
Numeric calculation of thermodynamic and informational quantities for the Landau-Zener model. The system is initially in canonical equilibrium, but it evolves unitarily.
The data.py file calculates the relevant quantities for various durations of the process and saves the results as text files. The graphs.py file plots these results.
